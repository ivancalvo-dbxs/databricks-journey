Unity Catalog (UC from now on) is the the unified governance solution for data and AI assets on Databricks.

More information:

- [Databricks Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog)
- [What is Unity Catalog?](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/)

## UC sits between your workspaces and data lake.

## Every data, ML and GenAI interaction goes through UC

* When an user or service principal:
  - Creates a table.
  - Populates a table.
  - Deletes a table.
  - Query a table.
* (Same for models, functions, views, schemas, volumes, etc...)
  
The grants and permission(s) verification happens on Unity Catalog as shown in the following diagram:

## Lessons learned

:::info What is UC?
Unity Catalog is a centralized metadata layer designed to manage data access, security, lineage, and governance across Databricks workspaces, enabling unified data management and secure collaboration.
:::

:::info Where is the data stored?
The data, metadata and AI models are always stored in your organization cloud account object storage.
:::

:::info How should every data+AI interaction should be done?
Through UC.
:::

:::danger What should be avoided?
- Accessing data, models or GenAI agents using hardcoded credentials.
- Configure data access on the clusters using external libraries + environment variables.

# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
