# Create Workspaces

An extended explanation can be found in: **[Functional Workspace Organization on Databricks
](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/03/10/functional-workspace-organization-on-databricks.html)**

## Three workspaces: Best practice and industry standard.

:::tip Recommended number of workspaces

- **Three workspaces.**
- **Aligned with the SDLC (dev, staging, production).**
    - Staging is often named as QA or testing depending on the organization context.
    - ***Treat your data and AI as you treat your code.***

### Short JSON visual representation.

- This is just a visual representation.
- This is NOT how workspaces, catalogs and permissions are defined.

```
{
  dev_workspace: {
    name: development,
    catalogs: [sandbox, dev]
    permissions: [
        de_team: [CAN_MANAGE, CAN_CREATE, CAN_READ, CAN_DELETE],
        devops_team: [ADMIN],
        ml_team: [CAN_READ, CAN_CREATE_MODELS],
        it_team: [CAN_READ],
        finance_consumers: [READ_ONLY, DASHBOARDS_ONLY]
    ]
  },

  staging_workspace: {
    name: staging,
    catalogs: [sandbox, staging]
    permissions: [
        automation_and_service_principals: [ADMIN, CAN_MANAGE, CAN_CREATE],
        devops_team: [ADMIN]
        de_team: [CAN_READ, DASHBOARDS_ONLY]
    ]
  },

  production_workspace: {
    name: production,
    catalogs: [production]
    permissions: [
        automation_and_service_principals: [ADMIN, CAN_MANAGE, CAN_CREATE],
        devops_team: [ADMIN],
        de_team: [CAN_READ, DASHBOARDS_ONLY],
        data_consumers: [CAN_READ, DASHBOARDS_ONLY]
    ]
  },
```

## Multiple business units setup

If three workspaces is not enought to separate your organization teams and business units do the following:

:::warning Business unit and teams separation. 

- Keep the three workspace idea.
- Add the (business unit | line of business | team name) as a prefix to the workspace names.
- For each (business unit | line of business | team name), create a dev - staging - prod workspace.

### Short JSON visual representation.

- This is just a visual representation.
- This is NOT how workspaces, catalogs and permissions are defined.

```
{
  // Finance follows the 3 workspace SDLC approach.  
  finance: {
    workspaces: [finance_dev, finance_staging, finance_prod],
    catalogs: [finance_dev, finance_staging, finance_prod],
    permissions: [
        de_team: [ADMINS],
        ml_team: [CAN_READ, CAN_CREATE_MODELS],
        it_team: [CAN_READ]
        finance_consumers: [READ_ONLY, DASHBOARDS_ONLY]
    ]
  },
  
  // HR solutions are simpler so only a non-prod and prod is required.
  hr: {
    workspaces: [hr_nonprod, hr_prod],
    catalogs: [hr_nonprod, hr_prod],
    permissions: [
        de_team: [ADMINS],
        hr_consumers: [READ_ONLY, DASHBOARDS_ONLY],
    ]
  }

## Single workspace: Not recommended, hard to scale and manage.

:::danger One place for all the jobs, pipelines, dashboards and AI models in a organization.
- Dev, Staging and Prod workloads on a single workspace is highly prone to errors.
- All users and automations service principals working and deploying on a single environment.
- ***This is the GIT equivalent of working only on the main branch.***
- ***Treat your data and AI as you treat your code.***
