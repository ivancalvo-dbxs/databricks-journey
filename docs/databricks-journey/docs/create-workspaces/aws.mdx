:::

:::danger Pre-requisite before deploy staging and production!
* Deploy the development workspace first using the provided template in the previous note.
* The development workspace template from the previous note creates the Unity Catalog metastore.
* The template ***02-aws-workspace*** does not includes the metastore creation.
:::

:::success Staging and Production Workspaces

* Deploy the **staging** and **production** workspace using Terraform.
* Deploy on the respective **staging** and **production** AWS accounts.
* Use the following TF template: **[02-aws-workspace](https://github.com/ivancalvo-dbxs/terraform-databricks-workspaces-2025/tree/main/aws/02-aws-workspace)**
  * The project similar as the 01-aws-workspace-metastore template. The metastore and UC admin groups is skipped.
