:::info Tip #1: Workspace name for environment isolation.
- Example #1: creating the first workspace (development).
  - **workspace_name** can be **dev** or **development**.
  - **workspace_name** can also include a prefix for a businesss unit.
    - i.e **finance_dev** or **finance_development**

**Note:** Apply the same idea to the **resource group** name.
