# 3. Cloud tenant(s)

Here is where the Databricks Journey starts!

## Journey progress

- [ ] **Identify your organization cloud tenant(s).**
- [ ] Create the workspace(s).
- [ ] Post-deployment configurations.
- [ ] Governance Strategy on Unity Catalog.
- [ ] Access your data from Unity Catalog.
- [ ] Create the first pipeline.
- [ ] Query and explore data from a DBSQL Warehouse.
- [ ] Create the first visualization using Dashboards and Genie.

## Target

This section aims to identify the cloud tenant for the initial deployment of Databricks and related cloud resources.

:::note cloud-tenant?
In this article, the term cloud tenant(s) refers to having one or multiple:
* Azure subscription(s).
* AWS account(s).
* GCP project(s).
:::

:::info
* A multi-tenant architecture aligns with SDLC best practices by isolating each organization’s cloud resources to enhance security and governance.
* **Databricks supports multi-tenancy.**
:::

## Outcome

* Identify which of the two scenarios from below matches your organization available tenant(s).
* Provision the workspace(s) in the appropriate tenant(s).

## Scenario #1: Single-tenant deployment

### Organization context

- My organization uses AWS.
- There is only one available AWS account.
- There is no plan to create new AWS accounts in the long-term so every required AWS resource for Databricks needs to be deployed on the available account.

### Databricks setup recommendation.

- Create the required Databricks AWS infra on the available AWS account.

## Scenario #2: Multi-tenant deployment.

:::info 
Databricks best practice recommendation — fully aligned with core cloud and software engineering principles.
:::

### Organization context
- My organization uses Azure.
- There are 3 different Azure subscriptions: dev, staging and prod.
- We want to isolate the Databricks and Azure resources as much as we can.
- Each environment data needs to be isolated on it's own location.

### Databricks setup recommendation.

- For each Azure subscription, create a Databricks workspace and the required Azure resources.

## Lessons learned

:::success Identify your current cloud scenario
* If only one tenant is currently available, check with your infrastructure team to determine whether additional tenants are planned in the short or mid term. This can help reduce future rework and redeployment efforts.
