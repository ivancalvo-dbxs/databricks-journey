# 6. Governance Strategy on Unity Catalog

## Journey progress

- [x] ~~Identify your organization cloud tenant(s).~~
- [x] ~~Create the workspace(s).~~
- [X] ~~Post-deployment configurations.~~
- [ ] **Governance Strategy on Unity Catalog.**
- [ ] Access your data from Unity Catalog.
- [ ] Create the first pipeline.
- [ ] Query and explore data from a DBSQL Warehouse.
- [ ] Create the first visualization using Dashboards and Genie.

## Target

* Explain the three most common UC catalog and permissions strategies on the industry.

## Outcome

:::success SUPER IMPORTANT
* **A solid governance strategy will lead to solid data+AI solutions**.
* **Start strong—because digging governance out of a data swamp is way harder than never falling in one.**
* **Stick to one of the presented strategies.**
:::

## Terminology and Acronyms

* **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Structured process of planning, building, testing, and operating cloud workloads, with clear isolation between development, staging, and production environments to reduce risk and prevent untested changes from impacting live systems.
* **Medallion Architecture:** [What is a medallion architecture?
](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture).


## Strategy #1 (most common): SDLC-based catalogs + project-medallion-based schemas

:::info Showcase
**The following diagram illustrates an example for a single catalog; the same concept applies to all catalogs:**
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/catalogs_1_simple.jpeg')} alt="description"/>
:::

:::info Catalogs 
* 3 main catalogs: **dev**, **staging** and **prod**.
    * More catalogs can be added: **uat**, **testing**.
:::

:::info Schemas 
* Every project has at least 3 schemas (project name is used as a naming prefix):
    * bronze schema.
    * silver schema.
    * gold schema.
    * optional:
        * A *data_source* schema exclusive to the project:
            * project_sqlserver (schema created from a Lakeflow Connect Ingestion pipeline which source is a SQLServer database).
:::

:::info Grants 
* Grants and permissions are applied at the schema level, which makes the governance simpler for the UC admins.
* One set of groups is enough to isolate the grants and permissions.
* Each project should have it's own dedicated BI or Data Consumers group for better grants isolation.
:::

## Strategy #2: BU-SDLC-based catalogs + project-medallion-based schemas

:::info SHOWCASE
**The following diagram illustrates an example for a single catalog; the same concept applies to all catalogs:**
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/catalogs_2_bu.jpeg')} alt="description"/>
:::

:::danger Catalogs
* Three main catalogs are insufficient to achieve the required data isolation across business units or departments.
:::

:::info Catalogs 
* For each business unit or deparment, there are 3 main catalogs: **bu_dev**, **bu_staging** and **bu_prod**.
    * More catalogs can be added: **bu_uat**, **bu_testing**.
:::

:::info Schemas 
* Every project has at least 3 schemas (project name is used as a naming prefix):
    * bronze schema.
    * silver schema.
    * gold schema.
    * optional:
        * A *data_source* schema exclusive to the project:
            * project_sqlserver (schema created from a Lakeflow Connect Ingestion pipeline which source is a SQLServer database).
:::

:::info Grants 
* Grants and permissions are applied at the schema level, which makes the governance simpler for the UC admins.
* Every business unit or deparment should have it's own set of groups to isolate the permissions.
* Each project should have it's own dedicated BI or Data Consumers group for better grants isolation.

## Strategy #3: Project-SDLC-based catalogs + medallion-based schemas

:::info SHOWCASE
**The following diagram illustrates an example for a single catalog; the same concept applies to all catalogs:**
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/catalog_3_project.jpeg')} alt="description"/>
:::

:::info Catalogs 
* The catalog strategy is focused on projects.
* For each project, there are 3 main catalogs: **project_dev**, **project_staging** and **project_prod**.
    * More catalogs can be added: **project_uat**, **project_testing**.
:::

:::info Schemas 
* For every project catalog, there is at least 3 schemas:
    * bronze schema.
    * silver schema.
    * gold schema.
    * optional:
        * A *data_source* schema exclusive to the project:
            * project_sqlserver (schema created from a Lakeflow Connect Ingestion pipeline which source is a SQLServer database).
