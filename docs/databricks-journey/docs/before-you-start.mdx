# 3. Before you start

### Identify your organization cloud setup

- [ ] A single-tenant.
- [ ] Multiple tenants.

:::note AWS
By cloud-tenants this article refers to having multiple:
* Azure subscriptions.
* AWS accounts.
* GCP projects.

**Note:** Multiple-tenants to follow the SDLC best practices and isolate an organization cloud resources.

## Single-tenant deployment

### Single-tenant example

- My organization uses AWS.
- There is only one available AWS account.
- There is no plan to create new AWS accounts in the long-term so every required AWS resource for Databricks needs to be deployed on the available account.

### Databricks setup recommendation.

- Create the required Databricks AWS infra on the available AWS account.

## Multi-tenant deployment (best practice and recommendation)

### Multi-tenant example
- My organization uses Azure.
- There are 3 different Azure subscriptions: dev, staging and prod.
- We want to isolate the Databricks and Azure resources as much as we can.
- Each environment data needs to be isolated on it's own location.

## Databricks setup recommendation.

- For each Azure subscription, create a Databricks workspace and the required Azure resources.

# Lessons learned

:::success Identify your current cloud scenario

If just one tenant is available, ask your Infra team if there is a plan in the short or mid-term to add more.

This would save you time and re-deployments in the future.
