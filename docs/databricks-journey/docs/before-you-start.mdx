# Before you start

Before deploying the Cloud and Databricks assets, it is crucial to determine the specific location within your cloud tenant where these assets will be created.

Databricks supports multi-tenant deployments designed to ensure both physical and logical isolation of users, groups, data, networking, and virtual compute environments.

## Identify your cloud tenant and sub-tenants

:::note AWS
- How many tenants do you have access to?
    - Azure subscriptions.
    - AWS accounts.
    - GCP projects.
- Do the accounts follow the SDLC dev-staging-prod isolation?
    - If so, apply the same SDLC idea with the Databricks workspaces and cloud resources

### Hypothetical case for a single-tenant scenario

- My organization uses AWS.
- There is only one available AWS account.
- There is no plan to create new AWS accounts in the long-term so every required AWS resource for Databricks needs to be deployed on the available account.

### Databricks setup recommendation.

- On the available AWS account, create the three workspaces and the required AWS resources.

## Multi-tenant deployment (best practice and recommendation)

### Hypothetical case for a multi-tenant scenario
- My organization uses Azure.
- There are 3 different Azure subscriptions: dev, staging and prod.
- We want to isolate the Databricks and Azure resources as much as we can.
- Each environment data needs to be isolated on it's own location.

## Databricks setup recommendation.

- For each Azure subscription, create a Databricks workspace and the required Azure resources.

# Lessons learned

:::success Identify your current cloud scenario

If just one tenant is available, ask your Cloud Team if there is a plan in the short or mid term to add more.

This would save you time and re-deployments in the future.

This is the Databricks best practice recommendation. Highly aligned with the cloud and software best principles.

- For each subscription, create:
    - 1x V-net.
        - 2x subnets.
        - 1x security group.
    - 1x ADLS
        - 1x container.
    - 1x UC access connector.
    - 1x Databricks Workspace.
        - The workspace is going to use all the previous Azure assets.
