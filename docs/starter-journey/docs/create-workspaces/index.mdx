# Create Workspaces

An extended explanation can be found in: **[Functional Workspace Organization on Databricks
](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/03/10/functional-workspace-organization-on-databricks.html)**

## Journey progress

- [x] ~~Identify your organization cloud tenant(s).~~
- [ ] **Create the workspace(s).**
- [ ] Post-deployment configurations.
- [ ] Governance Strategy on Unity Catalog.
- [ ] Access your data from Unity Catalog.
- [ ] Create the first pipeline.
- [ ] Query and explore data from a DBSQL Warehouse.
- [ ] Create the first visualization using Dashboards and Genie.

## Target

* This section shows how to create the first Databricks Workspace (development) on the previously identified cloud tenant.
* Repeat the Terraform or manual method for the next workspaces (staging, uat, qa, prod, etc...).

## Outcome

* Databricks Workspace (development workspace).
* UC catalog (development catalog).
* Cloud infra.

## Three workspaces: Best practice and industry standard.

:::tip Recommended number of workspaces

- **Three workspaces.**
- **Aligned with the SDLC (dev, staging, uat, production).**
    - Staging is often named as QA or testing depending on the organization context.
    - ***Treat your data and AI as you treat your code.***

## Three workspaces per business unit or department

If three workspaces is not enought to separate your organization teams and business units do the following:

:::info Business unit and teams separation. 

- Keep the three workspaces idea.
- Add the (business unit | line of business | team name) as a prefix to the workspace names.
- For each (business unit | line of business | team name): create a dev - staging - prod workspace.

## A single workspace to manage everything

:::danger One place for all the jobs, pipelines, dashboards and AI models in a organization.
- Dev, Staging and Prod workloads on a single workspace is highly prone to errors.
- All users and automations service principals working and deploying on a single environment.
- ***This is the GIT equivalent of working only on the main branch.***
- ***Treat your data and AI as you treat your code.***
