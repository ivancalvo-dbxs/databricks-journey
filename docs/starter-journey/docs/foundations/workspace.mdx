# Workspace

A Databricks workspace is a **cloud-based environment** where users organize and work with notebooks, jobs, dashboards, data, and compute resources in one place. Its main purpose is to give teams a secure, collaborative hub for building, running, and governing data engineering, analytics, and AI workloads, often with separate workspaces for dev, test, and production.
