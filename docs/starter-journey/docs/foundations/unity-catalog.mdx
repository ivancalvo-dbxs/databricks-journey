# Unity Catalog

Unity Catalog (UC) provides a centralized governance solution for managing data and AI assets across Databricks environments.

More information on:

- [Databricks Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog)
- [What is Unity Catalog?](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/)

## UC sits between your workspaces and data lake.

## UC objects and the three namespace convention

![Unity Catalog Access](/img/uc-objects.png)

```sql 
--- catalog: first namespace.
--- schema: second namespace.
--- table / view / volume / model: third namespace
SELECT * from my_catalog.my_schema.my_table;

--- Example: Select the gold table sales from the galaxy project on the development catalog.
SELECT * from dev.galaxy_gold.sales;

-- Set a default catalog or schema
USE CATALOG dev;
USE SCHEMA galaxy_gold;

--- Uses the defined catalog and schema
SELECT * FROM sales;

```
## UC Governs All Data, ML, and GenAI Interactions

When a user or service principal performs any of the following actions:
* Use an **UC object**.
* Creates an **UC object**.
* Populates a **UC object** (catalogs, tables, schemas).
* Deletes an **UC object**.
* Queries a **UC object** (query, view, table).
* Runs an **UC object** (function, model).

UC verifies the associated grants and permissions, as illustrated in the following diagram:

## Lessons learned

:::info What is Unity Catalog?
Is the centralized governance layer designed to manage data access, security, lineage, and governance across Databricks workspaces, enabling unified data management and secure collaboration.
:::

:::info Where is the data stored?
The data, metadata and AI models are always stored in your organization cloud account.
:::

:::info How should every data+AI interaction should be done?
Through UC.
:::

:::danger What should be avoided?
- Accessing data, models or GenAI agents using hardcoded credentials.
- Configure data access on the clusters using external libraries + environment variables.
